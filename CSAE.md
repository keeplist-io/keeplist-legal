**Effective Date:** 04/19/2025
**Last Updated:** N/A

**1. Our Commitment to Child Safety**

Keeplist, Inc. ("Keeplist," "we," "us," "our") is fundamentally committed to maintaining a safe online environment and protecting children. We have an unwavering **zero-tolerance policy** towards Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) in any form on Keeplist.io. The creation, sharing, promotion, distribution, solicitation, or accessing of CSAE material through our platform is strictly prohibited. We continuously work to refine our policies, enforcement mechanisms, and technologies, often in consultation with external child safety experts and trusted partners, to combat this threat effectively.

**2. Scope and Prohibited Content/Activities**

This policy applies universally across Keeplist.io, covering all content types and user interactions, including but not limited to profiles, posts, comments, messages, images, videos, audio, text, links, curated lists, and any other platform features.

We strictly prohibit the following categories of content and activity:

**a. Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) & Exploitation:**
Any content, activity, or interaction that depicts, promotes, threatens, supports, encourages, or solicits the sexual exploitation or endangerment of children. This includes:
    * Visual depictions (photographs, videos, drawings, AI-generated images, animations, art, lifelike representations like dolls, etc.) of sexual acts involving minors (individuals under 18 years of age, or the applicable legal age of majority).
    * Content showing or implying sexual activity between minors, minors and adults, or minors and animals.
    * Content portraying genital/anal stimulation or contact involving minors.
    * Sharing, distributing, requesting, or linking to known CSAM.

**b. Sexualization of Minors:**
Content that places minors in a sexualized context, even without explicit activity. This includes:
    * Depictions involving restraints, sexualized costumes, or staged sexual environments.
    * Imagery emphasizing genitals, anus, or female breasts (outside of clear breastfeeding contexts).
    * Presence of sex toys, visible adult arousal, open-mouth kissing, or sexual by-products in content featuring minors.
    * Any content placing minors in a fetishized or sexually suggestive pose, context, or narrative.
    * Profiles, groups, lists, or collections primarily dedicated to sexualizing minors.

**c. Solicitation, Grooming, and Inappropriate Interactions:**
    * Using Keeplist.io to entice, lure, or groom minors for sexual purposes.
    * Soliciting or attempting to arrange sexual encounters with minors.
    * Engaging in or soliciting sexually explicit communications with minors.
    * Coercing minors into sharing sexually explicit material or performing sexual acts (sextortion).
    * Any attempt to coerce, exploit, or threaten minors using intimate content for money, favors, or other gain.

**d. Child Nudity:**
We generally prohibit depictions of child nudity to mitigate risks of misuse and exploitation. Prohibited content includes:
    * Close-up imagery focusing on genitals, anus, or uncovered female nipples of minors.
    * Fully nude imagery (real or non-real) of minors where genitalia, anus, or uncovered female nipples are visible, including through transparent clothing.
    * *Exceptions:* Non-real imagery depicting child nudity may be permitted if clearly and neutrally educational (e.g., medical diagrams) or related to established real-world art. News-related imagery (e.g., depicting famine, war crimes) containing incidental child nudity may be permitted if displayed neutrally for informational purposes, potentially with viewer warnings. Breastfeeding imagery is permitted.

**e. Non-Sexual Child Abuse:**
We prohibit content that depicts, advocates, instructs, supports, or encourages the physical or emotional abuse of children.
    * *Exceptions:* Depictions of non-sexual abuse may be permitted if clearly within an educational, documentary, artistic, or fictional context (e.g., cartoons, video games, cinema), potentially with viewer warnings.

**3. Detection, Enforcement, and Safety Measures**

Keeplist utilizes a combination of technological tools (including proactive scanning technologies for known CSAM) and trained human moderation teams to detect, review, and act upon potential violations of this policy. We also rely heavily on user reports.

Based on detected violations or signals of potential misconduct, Keeplist reserves the right to:
* Immediately remove violating content.
* Suspend or permanently terminate user accounts.
* Restrict or disable user access to specific platform features.
* Apply warning labels or restrict content visibility (e.g., to adult users) for certain sensitive content that falls under exceptions (e.g., news reporting, educational material) but still warrants caution.

**4. Reporting to Authorities & Law Enforcement Cooperation**

Upon identifying credible CSAE material or activity, Keeplist is legally obligated and committed to promptly reporting such incidents, along with relevant user information where applicable, to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the United States and/or other appropriate national or international law enforcement agencies, as required or permitted by law. We cooperate fully with lawful investigations related to child exploitation on our platform.

**5. User Reporting**

If you encounter any content or behavior on Keeplist.io that you believe violates this policy, please report it immediately using our designated reporting tool within the application by going to the menu for an item, list, or profile and clicking "Report" or emailing [team@keeplist.io](mailto:team@keeplist.io).

**6. Expert Consultation**

We regularly consult with child safety experts, non-governmental organizations, and industry partners to inform and improve our policies, technologies, and enforcement strategies against CSAE.
